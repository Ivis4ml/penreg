## Introduction

Based on the following package: https://github.com/yixuan/ADMM

## Goals

* have capabilities for a wide range of penalties (lasso, group lasso, generalized lasso, overlapping group lasso, ridge) and combinations of them

* have capabilities for multiple models with any of the above penalties (gaussian, binomial, cox PH, etc)

* have capabilities for wide and tall data as well as sparse and dense matrices

* have some sort of unified interface to the fitting functions

* make the code as easily generalizable as possible
